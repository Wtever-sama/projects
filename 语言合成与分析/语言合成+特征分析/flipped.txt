I climbed the sycamore tree every day. 
Up there, the world seemed still and full of wonder. 
The leaves whispered secrets, and I felt like I was part of something bigger, something alive. 
People walked by, never noticing the magic right above them. 
But I did. 
That tree wasn’t just branches and bark—it was beauty, truth, and a place where I could dream. 
When they said it would be cut down, my heart sank. 
How could they not see? How could they not feel it the way I did?
